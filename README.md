# product-management
Product Management is a role that is shaped almost entirely by the stage and needs of the company. PMs fill the gray spaces between engineering and the rest of the org and are ultimately responsible for getting the best possible version of the product to market and ensuring that it adopted well. Occasionally, you will have partners in making that happen, but you have to assume that you alone bear the responsibility for making it successful. Shipping matters first, and being right matters in the long run.
